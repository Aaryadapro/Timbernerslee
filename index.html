            <p>Tim Berners-Lee is a software engineer who invented the Internet (or the World Wide Web) in 1989 while at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory.
                He is director of the World Wide Web Consortium that he founded and a Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Oxford.
                In 2001 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 2004 he was knighted.<br /><br />In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston
                It was made up of companies that wanted to work together to create Web standards and also improve the Web. It was quickly agreed that the technology should be free of royalties and patents. Berners-Lee has served as director of this W3C since it was founded.
                In 1995 Microsoft produced the first version of Internet Explorer and this commercial browser created enormous growth in websites and web users.
                The Web was first used for e-commerce in 1997.
                Berners-Lee has said "I like to keep work and personal life separate."[77]

Berners-Lee married Nancy Carlson, an American computer programmer, in 1990. She was also working in Switzerland at the World Health Organization. They had two children and divorced in 2011. In 2014, he married Rosemary<br> Leith at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace in London. Leith is a Canadian Internet and banking entrepreneur and a founding director of Berners-Lee's World Wide Web Foundation.[80] The couple also collaborate on venture capital to support artificial intelligence companies.[81]

Berners-Lee was raised as an Anglican, but he turned away from religion in his youth. After he became a parent, he became a Unitarian Universalist (UU). When asked whether he believes in God, he stated: "Not in the sense<br> of most people, I'm atheist and Unitarian Universalist."

The web’s source code was auctioned by Sotheby’s in London during 23–30 June 2021, as a non-fungible token (NFT) by TimBL. Selling for USD $5,434,500, it was reported the proceeds would be used to fund initiatives<br> by TimBL and his wife, Rosemary Leith.
